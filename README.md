# Drum_Kit
## Build with:
### HTML
### DOM, key events 
### CSS animations. 
So by the end of this I practiced how to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes 
so that youâ€™ll know when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a particular button 
on your Website and you can respond to it
